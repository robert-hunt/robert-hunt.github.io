        <h2>Teaching & Outreach</h2>
        <p>While I am not currently teaching formal courses, I am actively involved in various educational outreach activities and creating educational content. Here are some highlights:</p>

        <section class="outreach-item">
            <h3>2024 Gallery of Fluid Motion</h3>
            <p>This video depicts and describes the diffusion-limited settling of porous particles in density stratified fluids. Here, the rate at which the particles settle is determined by the rate of diffusion of the density interface.
                by how fast they absorb salt relative to their volume, which causes smaller and thinner particles to settle faster.

            <h3>2024 GirlsGetMath @ ICERM</h3>
            <p>This is a short video from an activity I ran at Brown as part of the 2024 GirlsGetMath@ICERM program. We made custom SurferBots and visualized the wavefields to learn about
                the mechanics of wave generation and propulsion.

            <h3>2023 Gallery of Soft Matter</h3>
            <p>This video, directed and produced by Navid Hooshanginejad, describes a system of floating particles which interact through capillary attraction and magnetic repulsion. I worked on the analysis of this system
                and also contributed the surface visualization starting at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3veuABI6WVM&t=36s" target="_blank">0:36</a>.

            <h3>2022 Gallery of Fluid Motion</h3>
            <p>SurferBot is a surface robot which uses an eccentric motor to generate an asymmetric wavefield which induces propulsion. I worked with undergraduate Eugene Rhee to
                make this video, write a paper, and design an outreach program all focused on using SurferBot to study the physics of wave generation and propulsion.

            <h3>2019 Gallery of Fluid Motion</h3>
            <p>This video describes the phenomenon of diffusion-induced aggregation, where particles drive flows in density stratified fluids which can cause them to aggregate
                and remain bound together. This was the first video I ever made, related to my doctoral research and this <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-13643-y" target="_blank">publication</a>. </p>
