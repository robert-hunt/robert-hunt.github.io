        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>
            My research focuses on the fascinating world of fluid dynamics, particularly in multiphase systems and at interfaces. I investigate how fluids, solids, and solutes interact in natural and engineered systems, using a combination of custom experiments, theoretical modeling, and computational simulations. My work spans a wide range of applications, from understanding particle aggregation in stratified fluids to developing novel aquatic robots. Through this research, I aim to uncover fundamental mechanisms that govern fluid behavior and apply these insights to solve real-world problems in fields such as environmental science, biomedical engineering, and soft robotics.

                <p class="summary">This project uses a common optical mouse sensor to measure fluid velocities at a sample rate over 6kHz for orders of magnitude lower in
                    cost than devices used for comparable measurements. After proposing the concept and developing a prototype, I led a proposal for a Hazeltine Innovation Award
                    which was funded for $50,000. I am working to characterize and validate the sensor under various operating and flow conditions, and I am working with research
                    engineer Eli Silver to develop an open-source project which will include the sensor and related software and hardware.</p>

                <p class="summary">This work investigates the streaming flow induced by wavemakers which oscillate at an air-water interface. I have been able to analytically predict the
                    structure of these flows, which emerge as the axisymmetry of the wavemaker is broken, and I validate these predictions using a custom method for simultaneous
                    surface reconstruction and surface velocity measurement (pictured above). Organisms generate such flows for feeding and locomotion, and I hope to use these predictions
                    to better understand these natural processes while also developing methods for wave-based control of surface particles.
