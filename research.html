        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>
            My research focuses on multiphysics interactions in fluid dynamics, particularly investigating how multiphase fluids, solids,
            and solutes interact. 
            I investigate these using a combination of custom experiments, 
            theoretical modeling, and computational simulations. Much of my work is motivated by ocean and atmospheric systems, working to understand mechanisms which govern processes like
            carbon sequestration and microplastics transport.

                <p class="summary">This project uses a common optical mouse sensor to measure fluid velocities at a sample rate over 6kHz for orders of magnitude lower in
                    cost than devices used for comparable measurements. After conceptualizing the device and developing a prototype, I led writing a proposal for a Hazeltine Innovation Award
                    which was funded for $50,000. I am working to characterize and validate the sensor under various operating and flow conditions, and research
                    engineer Eli Silver and I are working to develop an open-source project which will include the sensor and related software and hardware.</p>

                <p class="summary">This work investigates the streaming flow induced by wavemakers which oscillate at an air-water interface. I have been able to analytically predict the
                    structure of these flows, which emerge as the axisymmetry of the wavemaker is broken, and I validate these predictions using a custom method for simultaneous
                    surface reconstruction and surface velocity measurement (pictured above). Organisms generate such flows for feeding and locomotion, and I hope to use these predictions
                    to better understand these natural processes while also developing methods for wave-based control of surface particles.
