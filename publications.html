                <p class="summary">This study investigates the settling behavior of porous particles in stratified fluids, motivated by carbon sequestration in the
                    ocean. In a low Rayleigh number regime, the motion of these particles is determined by the rate at which they absorb salt, which causes small particles
                to settle faster and for the settling of large aspect ratio shapes to be determined by the thin dimension. This was sort of my postdoc pet project - check out this

                    and research engineer Eli Silver, this work describes the design and construction of the flume, which is built for around $1000 in parts using accesible tools and materials.
                    I helped design a prototype of the flume with Eli when he was an undergraduate as part of publication [6] below. I also worked with Maya during her master's to analytically model, experimentally
                    validate, and characterize the flow behavior.

                <p class="summary">This study examines the drag forces on a partially immersed sphere at an air-water interface. Here, the drag is mainly driven by gravity,
                    allowing for forces much greater than the fully immersed case. Surface tension plays an important role at small scales;
                    superhydrophobic coatings, typically used for drag reduction, can actually increase the drag in this regime. I led modeling and experimental efforts and
                    worked with undergraduate/research engineer Eli Silver to design the flume.

                <p class="summary">This paper presents a fundamental mechanism for particle aggregation in stratified fluids where a solute gradient interacting with a particle
                    induces a fluid flow. This flow creates a force between particles which can cause them to aggregate and remain bound together in the absence of adhesion. I
                     used analytical and numerical methods to model this force through singularity techniques and Stokesian dynamics simulations. I also developed experiments to
                     validate the induced flow and particle interactions, and I made this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=So_hN5se-IE" target="_blank">video</a> to help explain the work.
